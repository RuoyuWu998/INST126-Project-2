Hangman Game
## Introduction: 
The project is aim to to create a Hangman Game which H randomly select one word from a given list, and the user must guess the word. 
words = [“WHDSPQZ”, “XHO”, “TTDBFRT”, “QQJYF”, “ENQD”, “DNPK”, “CNTR”, “EHWHOD”, “TSVMOHOF”, “XNOCFQGTM”]
These words in the list are encoded messages. These should be decoded only if the user is able to guess the word correctly. The user is allowed to make 10 incorrect guesses.
